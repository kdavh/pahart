C              (F)  (Em) (Dm)(G)  C 
  The morning stars have fad-ed away,

  And lighting up the day.

C      Am            F         G        C
  Ooh, let that light brighten up your life.

Come on everybody and greet the day.

     F    G                  C
Wake up, Bobby, what do you say.

Shine                1972
CAPO V  (in memory of Richard Conrad)

Chorus:
(G)                           C                           D
...Shine.  Give your light a chance to show,

          G                       C                           D
And shine.  Give your love a chance to grow.

            G                    C                      G
Then shine.  We can set the world aglow,

                  C      Bm     Am7      D      G
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine.


                    C                          D                 G
How many of the things we cherish really matter?

                          C                             D
They’re simply games we learn to play.

G                C                      Bm                              Am7
Life is the center.  It’s the door through which we enter.

               G                       C              D        G
We are free to hope and be, and to let it (shine.)


Ah, what care and pains we take to mask our faces,
And how we struggle with our roles.
Old fools and dancers, I believe they have the answer.
They make light of who they are, and they let it (shine.)

(Chorus)

Every dawning holds for us a soft reminder.
The light it brings flows on and on.
Embrace the sun.  Go on, laugh and sing and run.
We have only just begun to let it (shine.)

(Chorus)




Dumpster Diving         1997

It’s a spring afternoon on Chicago’s South Side
In the Pilson neighborhood 
Two star crossed lovers drinking tea with each other
On the front porch and feeling good.
They got Afro Pop World on the radio
Swappin’ stories ‘bout the kids at school
Then Martin turns to Liz ‘n says, If you’re not too busy,
There’s something that I’d like you to do

Chorus:
Take me dumpster diving
It’s my favorite game
You can lose your blues ‘n maybe find some new shoes,
Its never the same.
It’s one way of survivin’
On society’s ills
Just a like a big thrift store, only it’s outdoors
And we’re savin’ landfills

They’ve got a third world perspective on the use of their cash.
An attitude that we could share
Those M V Essers aren’t known as fancy dressers
And they even cut each other’s hair
Well, they might do the tango, or even share a mango
In shower if their in the mood
A tightwad couple who avoid financial trouble
By shopping in the neighborhood.

They go dumpster diving... (chorus)

They ride to work on bikes, they like to camp and hike
They think that bluegrass is out of sight
Gender roles get flipped in this relationship
That’s why Martin’s doing curry tonight
But when the food is all gone and the dishes are done
And they’re lookin’ for some fun to share
Lizzie looks him in the eye, breathes a passionate sigh and says
If you really care ...

You take me dumpster diving...  (chorus)




More than you’ll ever know      June 2001
Capo III

G                         D           G
You were the one who was looking for God.

C         G            D
I mostly looked for romances.

C            D             G      Em
You were the one with the perfect body,

C                G            D
And I wondered what were my chances?


Chorus:
       C    D   G
And I love you now 

        C     D   Em
Like I loved you then, 

C                D     G
More than you’ll ever know.

C             D      G
Wish I could find a way

    F   C    D
To make it show



I was the one with the song in my heart.
You were the one with ambitions.
How could I guess where you would lead us. 
Remember, I’m just a musician.

(Chorus)

Love without effort is no love at all.
That cannot be any clearer.
What do I use for my inspiration?
You should just look in the mirror.




Curly Maple Back and Sides          1998
Capo V 

Am           G     Am                  G      Am   
She was born in mid-November on a gray Wisconsin morn,
                 G      Am          F               C
And her grandpa sent a present celebratin' she was born.
       Am              C            Dm            F
The guitar he set her daddy for to sing her lullabies
          Am     G         Am             F     G        Am
Like the hills around her home had curly maple back and sides
       C                           G            
Curly maple back and sides, curly maple back and sides,
          Am               F              G              Am
Like the hills around her home had curly maple back and sides


               G       Am                     G        Am
Now the maple tree is lovely and its wood is hard as stone,
                    G    Am                   F               C
And the young girl grew among them and their seasons were her own.
         Am            C               Dm            F
And the music in her blood so like the sap began to rise
          Am        G      Am             F     G        Am
When she sang with the guitar with curly maple back and sides.
       C                           G
Curly maple back and sides, curly maple back and sides,
          Am               F              G              Am
When she sang with the guitar with curly maple back and sides.


                  G       Am                    G        Am
Oh, the sweetness of the music, like the sugar from the tree
                  G         Am                F              C
Is the sweetest when it’s shared among your friends and family.
        Am                 C                 Dm                F
And we pray the maid will ne’er forget her friends and fam’ly ties
        Am       G     Am              F     G        Am
As she plays on her guitar with curly maple back and sides.
       C                           G
Curly maple back and sides, curly maple back and sides,
        Am              F              G              Am
As she plays on her guitar with curly maple back and sides.




Sing me home              2000

C                   C7                  F            C
When I’m down and troubled, and there’s no hope anywhere,

     F                C                D           G
And both my head and heart are in the belly of despair,

     C             C7                  F                 C
When I can see the end is near, and I don’t much really care,

  F                   G                C
I need my friends to come and sing me home.

Chorus:
         F   C          F                   C
Sing me home.  How I long for that sweet sound.

       F             C             D            G
Build me a quilt of harmony and spread it all around.

        C                 C7         F              C
Wrap me up in that sweet melody and turn my heart around.

        F               G               C
Pick me up an’ hold me tight.  Sing me home


When what I need is kissin’, and kisses can’t be found,
And my ship of dreams is out there somewhere hung up on dry ground.
When the pieces of my broken heart are scattered all around,
I need my friends to come and sing me home.

(Chorus)

When I start feeling jealous of the dog without a bone,
And all my prayers return to me, “Addressee Unknown”,
When I can’t face another day of this world on my own,
I need my friends to come and sing me home.

(Chorus)




Chicago Wedding Song    1997

If you’d have asked me years ago
I never would have guessed
That this unlikely couple
Could ever be this blest.
If I’d used the standard measures
For the chance of love’s success,
Like she’s too smart and he’s too old,
I doubt they’d pass the test.

Chorus:

I never would have picked these two 
To open up my eyes.
I thought I had things figured out, 
When much to my surprise, I learned again,
That with Love, all things are possible.


I don’t claim to be an expert
In matters of the heart
But I believe that heaven’s blessed these two
In giving them this start
And all of us as witness here
Share in this solemn troth,
From this time forth responsible
For nurturing them both.

(Chorus)




Singin’ Softly        1970


Singin’ softly to myself 
I remember, in my music,
Things we said.  No, I don’t remember when.
But the times are different now. 
Yeah, we both have changed a lot,
And I don’t long for things that might have been. 

Do you ever stop and wonder
What it was that made it good?
How we laughed and loved the nights away.
And if we ever meet again,
Will you come and walk beside me,
Hold my hand, and know what I can’t say?




Sunshine Woman            1971


I have walked along these paths and through these hills before,
Seen the sun and moon and stars and felt the storms.
But the freshness of these memories I still recall,
Cradled in my sunshine woman’s arms.

Chorus:
Sunshine woman touch my heart and make it soar.
Come and sing for me your love songs like you never sang before.
Sunshine woman let me hold you close once more.

I may never see her standing in the morning light.
Her eyes may never smile for me again.
But I have known her love and I cannot forget
A kiss that was as gentle as the rain.

There’s a hill off in the distance I ain’t seen before.
I feel a lot like goin’ now and then.
There’s a thousand misty mornings knockin’ at tomorrow’s door.
One of them may bring her back again.




Rainbow Gardens

It was 1925.  The big depression had yet to arrive.
Emma slipped out her bedroom window to go dancin’
Life didn’t seem quite so hard when a girl had a full dance card,
And she was swaying to the tuness of Tiny Hill or Wayne King

Chorus:
Excuse me mister.  I beg your pardon.
I was hopin’ that you might be goin’ my way
I'm lookin' for a ride down to the Rainbow Gardens,
So I can listen to the band and dance the night away

Arnold was a big man, six two, maybe, two ten,
Workin’ weekends as the bouncer at the Rainbow Gardens.
When he wasn’t showin’ folks to the door, he’d take his turn on the old dance floor.
That's where he and Emma fell in love while they were waltzin’.

Just west of Chicago, a little town called Marengo
Where the Mob ran liquor in the days of Prohibition
Emma worked the restaurant, and Arnold threw the worst drunks out
While their little boy played on the floor at the Rainbow Gardens.




With You                              2008
Capo II

C            E7
   I been wond’rin’    if you knew
F           C
   How I feel when I get   close to you.
C            E7
   There’s this place that you    take me to.
      F                    C
   It makes me happy just to be alive.

Chorus:
          F         G           C
   It’s like feeling the pulse of a river,
         F              G             C
   Or touching the face of the wind.
 F                        G              Am
   I can’t quite it explain where it is or how to get there,
      F                               G
   But I  can’t wait to go back again
      C – G – Am – G      C – G – Am – G – C – F - G
   With you…           You.

Sap is risin’ from the trees,
Nectar’s callin’ to the honey bees.
If I asked you, pretty please, 
Would you stay here next to me?

Starlight misted ev’ning air,
A tongue-tied hoot owl, he just blinks and stares.
If I told you that I care,
Would you say you’d marry me?




Lady Liberty                              Fall 2010

There she stands above the water, and she holds her torch up high
To welcome all the sons and daughters who come here to find a life.
And she promises to welcome all the tired and the poor
I guess someone should tell her , they're not welcome anymore.

Yeah, she calls the huddled masses who are yearning to breathe free.
She's the mother of the immigrant, our lady liberty.

I met a family down in Brownsville, been there since 17 and 10.
Said they never crossed the border.  Said the border, it crossed them
When the United States of Arrogance invaded with the war,
Taking what belonged to Mexico, now their not welcome anymore.

Well my daddy's daddy's great grand daddy sailed across the sea
To the home of the brave and the land of the free
But if he made that journey now and he was standin' on our shore,
Well, I bet he'd find, like others, he's not welcome anymore.



God Knows                    2010

God knows I love my mother.
God knows I didn’t choose her.
God knows that it’s just my good luck
My daddy’s not a boozer.
And I did not pick this white skin
Though it fits me pretty well.
It’s my discount racial tattoo,
And it keeps me out of jail.

Well I could’ve been born browner, I could have been born poor.
I could have been born crippled.  Why I wasn’t, I’m not sure,
But God knows, God knows

God knows I am a Christian,
And God knows it’s not my fault.
My ma sent me to Sunday School, 
And I learned what I was taught.
God knows if there’s a heaven
God knows if there’s a hell.
God knows that after we’ve found out
We’re not allowed to tell.

Yeah, I could have been born Hindu.  Could have been a Jew
Could have been born Muslim.  Hell, I could have been born you
God knows.  God knows.

God knows I love my country
And speak English pretty well.
God hung me on my family tree
And this is where I fell.
God knows I am a Gringo
And I suspect it’s true
That I did not earn my birthright
And neither, friend, did you.

Yeah, I could have been born Chinese.  Could have been born Greek
Could have been born Cuban, or been born in Mozambique
God knows, God knows.
God knows, I bet She knows.




Friend Song           1972

I believe you know.  When you smile I think it shows.
We both have come a long, long way.
All the things we shared, the times we really cared, 
Have brought us where we are today.

Chorus
Oh, my friend, our lives have just begun.
And, oh, that all my friends could be as one.

If you look at me I know that you will see
A kind of joy that wasn’t there before.
And in the days to come I’ll recall you as the one
Who helped me know myself a little more.

Repeat chorus and end with first verse


Dropped it in the water     2004

My daddy an’ my brother an’ me went out
To go fishin’ on the Mark Twain Lake
Gonna try our hand at catchin’ a crappie
Take ‘em home an’ fry ‘em up
Curt was in the back with Dad’s new pole
Wonderin’ how deep was the water
Stuck that rod in to find the bottom
Must be just a little farther…

Chorus:
Uh, oh… he dropped it in the water
Dag gon’, I bet that things a gonner
That spot is deeper than he thought it was
Paddle over there a little bit Phil
Can’t you hold the dang canoe still?
Pity sakes, I can’t believe it happened again.

Dad and Curt took his canoe out 
To catch a few bluegill.
Tied the boat up to the dock
To load up all of their gear.
Dad gave his tackle box to Curt
And he stuck it in his pocket.
He stepped out to get in the boat
And that was when he lost it.

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Some folks fish for fishes.
Some Christians fish for men.
Some folks go out in their boat
And baptize their equipment.

(Chorus)
